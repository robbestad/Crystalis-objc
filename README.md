Crystalis
===========

A game I made for iPhone and iPad in 2011/2012

This was my first Cocos2D project, and it probably shows. 
I'm sharing this in case anyone wants to check out 
a iOS5/6-era project.

The code is ISC licensed (see LICENSE). The graphics are not, so if you
want to build a new version, please replace all graphic 
assets with your own.

### Old man memoirs

The first version of this game didn't have ARC (it didn't
exist). When Apple launched the option of enabling ARC I was
overcome with joy. That alone made cut down the amount
of time spent debugging by at least 80%.
